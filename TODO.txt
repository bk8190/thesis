Photoshoot with Harlie and pan device

Illustrate path that Harlie took along with path of leader

Mention Eric Perko's precision steering - citation
Chad's thesis - citation


In simulation - move target around, make sure Harlie doesn't stop
- moving target
- while moving, Harlie has to make patches to the original plan to avoid obstacles


- Record how long replanning takes
- Run the test and see how long it takes
- Start off with few obstacles, increase them

Is it OK to refer to Harlie as "he?"
