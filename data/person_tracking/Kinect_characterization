The Kinect has several disadvantages that had to be overcome, largely due to the closed-source nature of the skeleton-tracking software.  The Kinect has a limited field of view (57 degrees).  The Kinect was designed to track users from a fixed vantage point.  The Kinect is sensitive to vibration.  The Kinect does not work well in direct sunlight (vibration)



DISCRIMINTATION BETWEEN USERS


The Kinect has no built-in facilities for discriminating between users.  

If a user exits the scene, there is no guarantee that when the user is re-detected that user will be assigned the same ID.  The same is true if a target is momentarilly lost.  If the target is moving and the Kinect encounters a sudden jolt, the target will likely be lost, and it may be reacquired with a new ID.

Usually, as part of acquiring a new user, the Kinect will require calibration, in which the user stands in a 'Y' shape [PICTURE] so that their limbs can be mesaured.  The calibration step takes several seconds, and requires both the target and the Kinect to be still, which is problematic.  Luckily, the software can be instructed to skip calibration and just load a pre-saved calibration.


I hypothesize that the Kinect has a reliance on background subtraction. 

The Kinect cannot easily acquire moving targets.

a smoothing factor (one of the few user accessable parameters)

The Kinect is interfaced through OpenNI (Open Natural Interraction) drivers which provide an open-source API.  However, the skeleton tracking itself is done in a closed source binary (NITE, made by PrimeSense.)  Therefore little can be done to improve the dropout rate on moving targets.






Harlie's Kinect was mounted in such a way that it cannot see legs (INSERT MECHANICAL DRAWING OF KINECT'S FOV) close up.  Luckily, the NITE software can be commanded to ignore legs and just track the target's upper torso.  The problem is that without legs, the tracking software loses an important characteristic that can discriminate people from inanimate objects.




LIMITED FIELD OF VIEW

The Kinect has a field of view of 57 degrees.  While this is sufficient for tracking a target with limited freedom from a fixed vantage point, it shows weaknesses for moving targets.

When using the Kinect as the sole source of observation, the robot must constantly face the user (within +- 30 degrees) or lose a target lock.  This puts severe constraints on its ability to maneuver and plan paths without losing the target.

Even following a target down a straignt hall one can run into problems.  If an obstacle appears between the user and the robot, the robot will have to navigate around the obstacle. (INSERT IMAGE HERE OF ROBOT AVOIDING OBSTACLE, INCLUDING TANGENT ANGLE DEVIATION FROM STRAIGHT PATH) Likely, as part of the avoidance the user will leave the Kinect's field of view, leading to a target loss.  When the robot once again faces the user, it will have to re-find the user.

The situation becomes worse when the user takes a twisting path, especially doubling back behind the robot.  In tight spaces such as hallways, the user will necessarily come close to Harlie when moving behind it.  Because the Kinect cannot track targets closer than two feet away, this frequently leads to target loss.  Additionally, the robot can get stuck against a wall with no hope of recovery.




MOVING BASE PROBLEM

The Kinect was designed to track skeletons from a fixed vantage point (in front of a television.)
The Kinect was not meant to be mounted on a moving base.  I performed some tests to characterize how well the Kinect can track moving targets from a moving vantage point such as Harlie's back.  First, the robot was rotated back and forth through 1 radian of angle (approximately the Kinect's FOV) with a sinusoidal velocity profile.  Second, step commands were given in angular velocity and the affect on tracking was observed.  Target acquisition and tracking was tested up to 0.8 radians/second in both cases.

When the Kinect is still, its performance was best.  The Kinect can detect users rapidly moving through the scene, and it can easily deal with partial occlusion.  The Kinect only lost a lock when a target moves very quickly, or exits and reenters the scene.  The Kinect can be confused if two users come close together, not being able to tell users apart by means other than their spatial positions.

As expected, the Kinect's performance gradually degrades with the speed of rotation.  With a peak or step inputs below 0.3 radians/sec (17 degrees/sec), the performance is almost identical to the case of standing still.  The Kinect is still able to robustly track targets through its field of view without many drops.

As the maximum speed increases, performance starts to degrade.  Around 0.5 radians/sec, the target will occasionally occasionally be dropped.  Usually the Kinect will reacquire it right away, resulting as a flickering effect as the Kinect struggles to keep a lock.  The incidence of flickering increases with speed, and well as the chance that the Kinect will lose a target and not reestablish it.  Target loss was especially noticable when the Kinect is jolted or given a sharp step command in velocity.

The quality of target tracking is also dependent on the environment.  The Kinect is able to track closer users more reliably, likely because they have a greater number of constituent pixels.  Occluded users are more dificult to track, especially if the occluding object is close by [INSERT PICTURE OF CHAIR BEING INTERPRETED AS BODY PART].

All of these effects are dependent on speed.  Even so, at the maximum tested speed of 0.8 radian/second, the Kinect performed remarkably well given that it is operating outside of its design parameters.  Although it frequently loses a lock, it is usually able to reacquire.





Targets further away from the Kinect
I hypothesize that the Kinect uses background subtraction and tracks users frame-to-frame.  Tracking is a more difficult problem when the base is moving.  If the
