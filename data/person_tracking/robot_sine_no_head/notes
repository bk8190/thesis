When the target is stationary OpenNI works very well, very robust

At .2 rad/sec just as robust
- Command constant spin, walk around the robot, experiment with moving in and out but staying in field of view
- Give a step command by engaging/disengaging E-stop
- Works very well, just as good as stationary


.3 m/s - performane degrades
- Does good job of tracking a person that keeps pace with the robot
- Confused by step commands 50% of the time
- Often loses targets standing still - often lost for 1-2 frames and then reacquired
- Performs worse for targets >1.5m away

If a target keeps pace with the camera, moving to stay in front of the robot, lockon is maintained even at high speeds



- Closer than 60cm, Kinect does not work




Rotated robot around 1 radian (57 deg, approx Kinect FOV) sin wave, top speed .8 rad/sec
- No dropouts when the target is stationary in view
- Many dropouts when the target starts to move, especially counter to rotation
- Target flickers at higher speeds
- Usually target is reacquired, but often as a different player ID
- Performs worse for targets farther away


- Many dropouts when target goes behind object like chair
- Consistent with background subtraction - moving objects are harder to segment
