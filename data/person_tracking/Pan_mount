To alleviate some issues inherent with the Kinect (limited field of view, moving base) it was decided to build a rotating mount to allow the Kinect to face its target.

The ServoCity DDP155 Base Pan was selected.  The DP155 is a low-cost, direct-drive pan mount that encorporates a standard servo.[INSERT PICTURE]  The DP155 has a ball-bering shaft that makes the pan head extremely rigid, reducing axial stresses on the servo.  The GET NAME hobby servo was selected.

An Arduino was considered because of their wide hobbyist support.

To drive the servo, the 1066_0 PhidgetAdvancedServo 1-Motor was selected.  The Phidgets 1066_0 allows precise open-loop control of a hobby servo at 30 Hz, obeying constraints on velocity and acceleration.  Phidgets also provides a convenient C API to can command rotation angles and change options.  The device is completely powered by a USB port, and provides real-time feedback on current consumption as well as open-loop feedback on position and velocity.

The TF (transform) API of ROS was used to take care of the time-varying transform between the Kinect and the rest of the robot.  A node subscribes to a position from the person tracker, transforms it to coordinates relative to Harlie's base frame, and publishes a target angle.  The head controller subscribes to this angle and   .  [INSERT FIGURE]
